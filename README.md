# Can i support this?

## Description

This website uses the OpenAi API to find important information about actors and companies involved in a specific movie via TMDB API.

The idea is to have an overview of any controversies related to the people that worked on a specific movie so that you can have a better opinion on if you want to support specific actors of companies with your money.

## What i used to make this website:

- Create-React-App
- React Router
- Bootstraps for the icons
- Local Storage for handling the favorites
- TheMovieDatabase API for the movie and cast information
- OpenAI API for the ChatGPT response
- Jest for some small unit testing
- Media queries for responsive web design
- Git/Github for version control
- Firefox accessibility software

### To test this website locally

Once you clone it the only thing you need is your own [TMDB API KEY](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [OpenAI KEY](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to be saved in a .env file with these names:

- REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY={your key}
- REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY={your key}
